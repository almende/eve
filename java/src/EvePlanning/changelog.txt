2012-08-22, version 0.7

- Extensive changes in the MeetingAgent. The meeting agent does not just find
  a free timeslot for all attendees. Instead, it collects the busy profiles
  and preferences, a sets up hard constraints (infeasible timeslots) and 
  soft constraints (preferred timeslots), and calculates the optimal solution.  
  Optional attendees can be handled now, as well as other preferences.
- Changed/extended the Activity class. Changes:
    - specified status.attendees[] with fields
          {String} status.attendees[].displayName
          {String} status.attendees[].email
          {String} status.attendees[].agent
          {Boolean} status.attendees[].optional
          {String} status.attendees[].responseStatus
    - added field {String} status.activityStatus
    - removed field status.error (use status.activityStatus instead)
    - replaced {String} status.location with {Object} :
          {"summary": null, "lat": null, "lng": null}
- Renamed method MeetingAgent.setEvent with MeetingAgent.setActivityQuick
- Fixed a bug in the GoogleCalendarAgent, the method deleteEvent did not 
  return a 404 error but an internal error when the event was not found.

  calendars, reckons with office hours, and leaves its url in the calendar

  interval. Once the meeting is past, it stops checking.
