## EVE - Website and documentation

Eve is a multipurpose, web based agent platform. The project aims to develop 
an open protocol for communication between software agents. Eve is designed as 
a decentral, scalable system for autonomously acting agents. Eve uses the 
existing world wide web as platform, and uses existing protocols for data 
exchange (HTTP) and for messaging (JSON-RPC).

This project contains the website and documentation of Eve.
There are various implementation of Eve available:

- A Java implementation at: https://github.com/almende/eve-java
- A JavaScript implementation as part of Enmasse.io: https://github.com/enmasseio/evejs

Full documentation is available on http://almende.github.com/eve
